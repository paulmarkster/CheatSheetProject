The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were <span class="code">static</span>. This value creates a new stacking context when the value of <span class="code">z-index</span> is not auto. Its effect on <span class="code">table-*-group</span>, <span class="code">table-row</span>, <span class="code">table-column</span>, <span class="code">table-cell</span>, and <span class="code">table-caption</span> elements is undefined.</td>

The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (if any) or to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of <span class="code">top</span>, <span class="code">right</span>, <span class="code">bottom</span>, and <span class="code">left</span>. This value creates a new stacking context when the value of <span class="code">z-index</span> is not auto. The margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not collapse with other margins.</td>

The element is positioned relative to its initial containing block, which is the viewport in the case of visual media. Its final position is determined by the values of <span class="code">top</span>, <span class="code">right</span>, <span class="code">bottom</span>, and <span class="code">left</span>. This value always creates a new stacking context. In printed documents, the element is placed in the same position on every page.</td>
